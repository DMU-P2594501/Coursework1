<!-- Synopsis -->
<h2>About The Dark Knight</h2>
<p>The Dark Knight was the second instalment of Christopher Nolans (Directer/Producer/Co-Writer) Dark Knight Trilogy. Inspired by multiple Batman comic books, including The Killing Joke and The Long Halloween, The Dark Knight has become one of the most beloved and successful superhero films ever made. One big reason for this is the incorporation of game theory. This glued everyone to their seats as morale dilemmas are thrown left and right as Batman must decide between selfishness and selflessness, becoming a true hero in the process. Because of this, Christopher Nolan had created a very relatable and realistic version of Batman that we have never seen before.</p>
<h3>Plot</h3>
<p>With the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent, Batman makes it his goal to put an end to organised crime, that has been contaminating Gotham, once and for all. However, the trio find themselves targeted by an upcoming criminal mastermind known as The Joker. The Joker uses his unique skills to create chaos and forces The Dark Knight into an impossible decision, leading him onto the line between a hero and a vigilante.</p>
